# 📊 Surveying the Data Community

This repository contains my analysis of survey responses from **630 professionals working in data-related fields** across multiple countries. As a fresher exploring data, I wanted to understand **career satisfaction, skill adoption, and demographics** in the global data community.

## 🔍 Overview

The survey explores:

* 🌍 **Work-Life Balance & Salary Satisfaction** — comparing India with Western countries
* 🐍 **Programming Language Adoption** — with a focus on Python usage among Data Analysts
* 👩‍💻 **Demographics** — age trends across regions
* 📈 **Survey Representation** — how responses were distributed by country

## 📌 Key Insights

* Professionals in **India** reported **below-average happiness** regarding salary and work-life balance, while the **US, UK, and Canada** rated **5+/10** (some close to 6/10).
* Those who had a **harder time breaking into data roles** also reported lower satisfaction with salary and balance.
* **Python is the global favorite**, but adoption in India (31/73) is comparatively lower than in the US (90/261).
* Average age of data professionals: **India (27), UK (32), US (31), Canada (30)** — showing India’s workforce is **notably younger**.
* Survey representation: **US (261), India (73), UK (40), Canada (31), Others (224)**.

## 🚀 Future Work
