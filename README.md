📊 Surveying the Data Community

This repository contains my analysis of survey responses from 630 professionals working in data-related fields across multiple countries.
As a fresher exploring data, I wanted to understand career satisfaction, skill adoption, and demographics in the global data community.

🔍 Overview
The survey explores:
🌍 Work-Life Balance & Salary Satisfaction — comparing India with Western countries
🐍 Programming Language Adoption — with a focus on Python usage among Data Analysts
👩‍💻 Demographics — age trends across regions
📈 Survey Representation — how responses were distributed by country

📌 Key Insights
Professionals in India reported below-average happiness regarding salary and work-life balance, while the US, UK, and Canada rated 5+/10 (some close to 6/10).
Those who had a harder time breaking into data roles also reported lower satisfaction with salary and balance.
Python is the global favorite, but adoption in India (31/73) is comparatively lower than in the US (90/261).
Average age of data professionals: India (27), UK (32), US (31), Canada (30) — showing India’s workforce is notably younger.
Survey representation: US (261), India (73), UK (40), Canada (31), Others (224).
